# Hi, I'm Joe Nash!

I work at [GitHub](http://education.github.com), mostly with the [Campus Experts](http://education.github.com/experts).

You can usually find me in these places:
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jna_sh)
- [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/jna_sh)
- [GitHub](http://github.com/joenash)

My favourite emoji is :sparkling_heart:, because it is clearly the best. 

A cool thing I read recently: [Melinda Seckington's blog on how she brainstorm's talk ideas](http://missgeeky.com/2016/11/21/how-to-brainstorm-talk-ideas/)

# Local Hack Day

During Local Hack Day I'll be at Sheffield, Nottingham, Loughborough and UCL, London. If you're at any of those sites, drop by and say hi!
